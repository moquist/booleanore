# booleanore

If you have a tree of boolean operators applied to unknown truth values, you can
bubble the disjuncts up into a single top-level disjunct of conjuncts. In other
words, you only need one "or".

These three sentences are equivalent:

English: "Sally likes pizza and ice cream, and she likes either lettuce or kale."

Logic tree: `[:and "pizza" "ice cream" [:or "lettuce" "kale"]]`

Disjunct of conjuncts:
```
[:or [:and "pizza" "ice cream" "lettuce"]
     [:and "pizza" "ice cream" "kale"]]
```

Once you translate from the logic-tree form to the disjunct-of-conjuncts, you can parallelize evaluation of all the possible true statements.

Here's how this evening-project code does it:

```
; => (bform->flattened-disjunct [:and "a"
                                      "b"
                                      [:or "c" "d"]
                                      [:or "e" "f"]])
[:or [:and "a" "b" "c" "e"]
     [:and "a" "b" "d" "e"]
     [:and "a" "b" "c" "f"]
     [:and "a" "b" "d" "f"]]
```
